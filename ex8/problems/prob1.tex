Start with the kNN-Algorithm that uses the euclidean distance as similarity measure.

\begin{align*}
d(x,y) &= \sqrt{(y-x)^T(y-x)} \\
       &= \sqrt{x^Tx - 2x^Ty + y^Ty}
\end{align*}

Apply the feature mapping $\phi$:
\[ d(x,y) = \sqrt{\phi(x)^T\phi(x) - 2\phi(x)^T\phi(y) + \phi(y)^T\phi(y)} \]

Now replace the scalar products with \emph{Kernels}:
\[ d_K(x,y) = \sqrt{K(x,x) - 2K(x,y) + K(y,y)} \]

The kernel does not necessarily need to implement the scalar product, but can also map the dataset to a higher dimension to make the dataset linearly separable.
