The constraint $f_1$ is active, as $f_1(x^*) = 0$.

We can also see this in the plot of the primal problem, as the point $x^*=2$ is on the border of the allowed space, and $f_0$ does not have a minimum at that coordinate.

A constraint is active:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\Rightarrow$]{there exists an infinitesimal motion in the space of $x$, that causes the constraint to be violated}
\item[$\Rightarrow$]{the solution of the constrained optimisation problem is not necessarily a minimiser of the corresponding unconstrained optimisation problem}
\end{itemize}
