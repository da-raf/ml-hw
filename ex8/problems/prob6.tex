Lagrangian is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{larger than objective function $\Rightarrow$ constraint is greater than 0 $\Rightarrow$ constraint is not satisfied}
	\item{smaller than objective function $\Rightarrow$ constraint function is smaller than 0 $\Rightarrow$ constraint is satisfied}
	\item{unaffected $\Rightarrow$ constraint function is 0 $\Rightarrow$ constraint satisfied}
\end{itemize}

The upper bound of $\min\limits_x L(x,\alpha)$ is $f_0(2) = 5$, the solution to this optimization problem.
